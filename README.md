# Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network

Repository to contain common Computer Vision related topics and CNN architectures using TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch.


### Work done so far:
1. Computer Vision mathematical theory - Batch normalization cancellation
2. Exponentially weighted average
3. LeNet-5 CNN
4. Conv-6 CNN (VGG styled CNN)
5. ResNet-18 CNN
6. Implementing Fully-Connected layer(s) as convolutional layer(s)
