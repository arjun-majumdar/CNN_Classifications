# Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network

Repository to contain common Computer Vision related topics and CNN architectures using TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch.


### Work done so far:
1. Computer Vision mathematical theory - Batch normalization cancellation
2. Exponentially weighted average
3. LeNet-5 CNN
4. Training a CNN using TensorFlow2 - 'tf.GradientTape'
5. Conv-6 CNN (VGG styled CNN)
6. ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 val_acc = 92.1% from scratch) - PyTorch
7. VGG-16 (CIFAR-10 val_acc = 88.39%) - TF2
8. VGG-18 (CIFAR-10 val_acc = 89.63%) - TF2 (linear warmup + step-decay) learning rate scheduler with _tf.GradientTape_
9. VGG-18 (CIFAR-10 val_acc = 92.92% from scratch) - PyTorch (linear warmpup + step decay) learning rate scheduler
10. Implementing Fully-Connected layer(s) as convolutional layer(s)
11. Learning rate: decay, warmup and scheduler
12. Implementing pruning (structured vs. unstructures, layer-wise vs. global) in PyTorch by using "torch.nn.utils.prune" for different architectures
13. Transfer Learning (ResNet-50) on CIFAR-10; val_acc = 92.58%
