# CNN_Classifications
Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition and classification

In this repository, I will update common architectures of CNN for different types of image recognition and classifications.

"LeNet_5_MNIST_CNN" Jupyter Lab notebook refers to MNIST dataset classification using LeNet-5 CNN architecture as proposed in the paper "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" by LeCun et al. using TensorFlow 2.0
