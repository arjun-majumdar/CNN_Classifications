# Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network

Repository to contain common Computer Vision related topics and CNN architectures using TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch.


### Work done so far:
1. Computer Vision mathematical theory - Batch normalization cancellation
2. Exponentially weighted average
3. LeNet-5 CNN
4. Training a CNN using TensorFlow2 - 'tf.GradientTape'
5. Conv-6 CNN (VGG styled CNN)
6. ResNet-18/34 CNN
7. VGG-16 (val_acc = 88.39%) CNN
8. Implementing Fully-Connected layer(s) as convolutional layer(s)


__NOTE:__ For most of these conv nets, extensive hyper-parameter tuning needs to be performed.
